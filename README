Outlook for Mac Exchange Setup 4.0 is a new set of scripts based on my Entourage Exchange Setup scripts that assist a Macintosh administrator in the pre-configuration of Outlook for Mac settings so that users will have common default preferences and will not be exposed to the details of having to set up their own Exchange accounts. Every companyâ€™s network is different so this script was written to provide enough ideas for a novice scripter to be able to adapt it for use in his network in just a few minutes.
