Purpose of the Outlook Exchange Setup 4.5 scripts

This set of two AppleScripts is intended to be modified by an administrator to assist his Outlook users with the setups of their Exchange server accounts. Every company's network is different so the primary script was written to provide enough ideas for a novice scripter to be able to adapt it for use in his network in just a few minutes.

The user's Mac OS X Name (also called the "Display name" if using Active Directory) and email address are assumed to be in the form of:

	"Last, First" and "first.last@domain.com"

But it can easily be modified for other variations such as:

	"First Last" and "first@domain.com

It works especially well if the Mac is bound to Active Directory where the user's Mac OS X Short Name will match the "User logon name" in Active Directory.

The OutlookExchangeSetup4.5.scpt script must first be edited in "AppleScript Editor.app" found in /Applications/Utilities and modified with server names appropriate to the network. If the user's computer login (short name, long name, etc.) is consistent with his Exchange server's login then it will work with little need for modification.


How do these scripts differ from the previous scripts?

The basic scripts have been updated for Outlook as part of Office for Mac 2011. AppleScript syntax has changed as well as default behavior of the application itself. Anything specific to Microsoft Entourage has been removed.

• Included instructions to set Entourage to work offline.
• Included instructions to uncheck Entourage's option to alert the user about a script modifying the address book.
• Changed the setup script to set the user's "email address" rather than the "default email address".
• Added single quotes in "Copy Entourage Files.app" script to allow for folder names with spaces.

3.0

• Added fix for correctly setting SSL authentication for LDAP (bug in Entourage 2008 only)

1.2

Note: The following bullet points complete the list of options that can be set for Exchange, Public folder and LDAP settings missing from the original scripts.

• Added the ability to set the Exchange Server SSL
• Added the ability to set the Exchange Server SSL port number
• Changed FreeBusyServer property name to PublicFolderServer to better match Entourage's field name
• Added the ability to set the Public Folder Server SSL
• Added the ability to set the Public Folder Server SSL port number
• Added the ability to enable LDAP Server authentication
• Added the ability to set the LDAP Server SSL
• Added the ability to set the LDAP Server SSL port number
• Added the ability to set the LDAP Server maximum results returned

• Added the option to turn off the "Send & Receive All" schedule. This schedule applies to POP and IMAP accounts only and does nothing with Exchange accounts.

• Added a "Setup check" section to alert users if an Exchange account has already been configured in Entourage. The script is only necessary the first time a user needs to configure Entourage but some users double-click the script again instead of just launching Entourage. This is an effort to prevent a user from setting up a second account in Entourage pointing to the same Exchange account.

• Changed the Account Name to display "Mailbox - Last, First" (or whatever selected name format is selected) to match the display that Outlook for Windows users see.

• Added a customizable error message in case the Exchange account setup fails.

1.1

• Added the ability to specify the LDAP search base.
