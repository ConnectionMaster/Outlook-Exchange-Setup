\
\

\b\fs29\fsmilli14800 Purpose of the Outlook Exchange Setup 4.0 scripts
\b0 \

\fs25\fsmilli12800 \
This set of two AppleScripts is intended to be modified by an administrator to assist his Outlook users with the setups of their Exchange server accounts. Every company's network is different so the primary script was written to provide enough ideas for a novice scripter to be able to adapt it for use in his network in just a few minutes.\
\
The user's Mac OS X Name (also called the "Display name" if using Active Directory) and email address are assumed to be in the form of:\
\
	"Last, First" and "first.last@domain.com"\
\
But it can easily be modified for other variations such as:\
\
	"First Last" and "first@domain.com\
\
It works especially well if the Mac is bound to Active Directory where the user's Mac OS X Short Name will match the "User logon name" in Active Directory.\
\
The 
\b OutlookExchangeSetup4.0.scpt
\b0  script must first be edited in "AppleScript Editor.app" found in /Applications/Utilities and modified with server names appropriate to the network. If the user's computer login (short name, long name, etc.) is consistent with his Exchange server's login then it will work with little need for modification.\
\
\

\b\fs29\fsmilli14800 How do these scripts differ from the previous scripts?
\b0 \

\fs25\fsmilli12800 \
The basic scripts have been updated for Outlook as part of Office for Mac 2011. AppleScript syntax has changed as well as default behavior of the application itself. Anything specific to Microsoft Entourage has been removed.\
